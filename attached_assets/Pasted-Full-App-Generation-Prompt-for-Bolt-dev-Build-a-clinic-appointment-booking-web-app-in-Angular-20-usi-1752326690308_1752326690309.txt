Full App Generation Prompt for Bolt.dev
Build a clinic appointment booking web app in Angular 20 using TailwindCSS v3.4.17 and Remix Icons, following a modular project structure.

üåê Core Features:
Admin panel with mobile-first layout: sidebar, header, and main content area.

Support Dark / Light / System mode with Tailwind theme switching.

Use Angular Signals for state management, @angular/core control flow syntax, and HttpResource for API calls.

Fetch mock data from json-server (db.json) via RESTful endpoints.

Implement auth with JWT: Login routes for Admin and Doctor, using Route Guards + HTTP Interceptors.

üìÜ Calendar Module:
Create a custom Calendar system with Month / Week / Day views using reusable components:

Navigation bar with dynamic month/year/week navigation controls.

Views should sync across modes (changing month updates all views).

Show appointment cards with correct start/end time blocks.

+x more indicator on Month View should redirect to Day View (not open popover).

On Week & Month views, clicking an event should open a popover (not modal):

Popover must respect viewport space, flip vertically/horizontally using getBoundingClientRect(), and be rendered outside parent (e.g., inside <body>).

Popover should auto-close when clicking edit, which opens right-side sliding form.

In Day View, popover is skipped. Clicking an event opens the form directly.

üü© Appointment Cards:
Color-coded by doctor or appointment type.

Overlapping appointments (e.g., 2 PM ‚Äì 3 PM and 2:30 PM ‚Äì 3:30 PM) must appear side-by-side using flex or grid strategy.

Past time slots and holidays must appear grayed out (weekends or configured holidays).

Block creating/editing/deleting past appointments.

Resizing and dragging should:

Map vertical mouse position to grid time slot (30 min)

Prevent end time < start time (e.g., 2 PM ‚Äì 10 AM is invalid)

Show a real-time time preview while dragging

Show modal to confirm updated time and show error if validation fails

üîß Admin Features:
Configure clinic working hours (time slots shown dynamically in Week/Day View).

CRUD for Holidays, Patients, Doctors.

Admin can view all appointments; doctors can view only their own.

Confirm delete with modal dialog.

üìÅ Project Structure:
Modular layout with /features, /shared/components, /core, /auth, /calendar, /patients, /doctors, /settings.

Lazy load routes; keep components and pages separated.

Follow clean architecture, scalable and production-ready setup.
