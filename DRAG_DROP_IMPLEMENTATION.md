# Drag and Drop Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented drag-and-drop functionality for appointment cards in Week and Day views while preserving all existing resize behavior. The implementation follows the requirements specified and provides a smooth, intuitive user experience.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### Core Drag-and-Drop Functionality

- **Vertical Dragging**: Change appointment time by dragging vertically
- **Horizontal Dragging**: Assign appointments to different doctors (Day view)
- **30-minute Slot Snapping**: Automatic snapping to 30-minute time slots
- **Live Preview**: Real-time visual feedback during drag operations
- **Validation**: Prevents dragging into invalid time slots and positions

### Smart Validation System

- **Past Time Prevention**: Cannot drag appointments into past time slots
- **Working Hours Enforcement**: Respects clinic hours (8 AM - 6 PM)
- **Weekend Blocking**: Prevents scheduling on weekends
- **Holiday Awareness**: Blocks scheduling on configured holidays
- **Doctor Availability**: Validates doctor availability before confirming moves

### Visual Feedback System

- **Blocked Slots**: Gray striped backgrounds for invalid time slots
- **Drag States**: Visual indicators for valid/invalid drag targets
- **Live Cursors**: Appropriate cursor changes during different operations
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded feedback during drag operations

### Confirmation Modal

- **Smart Confirmation**: Shows detailed summary of changes
- **Doctor Lookup**: Automatically fetches new doctor details when changed
- **Change Detection**: Highlights what specifically changed (time/doctor)

- Automatic doctor assignment based on column position
- Validates doctor availability in new time slots

#### State Management

- Uses Angular Signals for reactive state
- Preserves existing resize state management
- Clean separation between drag and resize operations

## üé® Visual Design

### CSS Enhancements

- **Drag States**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Blocked Slots**: Diagonal stripe patterns for invalid areas
- **Global Classes**: Body-level classes for operation states
- **Cursor Management**: Context-appropriate cursors
- **Z-index Management**: Proper layering during operations

### Color Coding

- **Blue**: Resize operations and valid states
- **Green**: Successful drag operations and valid targets
- **Red**: Invalid positions and error states
- **Gray**: Blocked/disabled time slots

## üîß Configuration

### Working Hours

```typescript
private readonly workingHours = {
  start: 8, // 8 AM
  end: 18,  // 6 PM
};
```

### Holidays

```typescript
private readonly holidays: string[] = [
  "2025-12-25", // Christmas
  "2025-01-01", // New Year
  "2025-07-04", // Independence Day
];
```

### Drag Threshold

```typescript
private dragThreshold = 5; // Minimum pixels for drag detection
```

## üéØ User Experience

### Interaction Flow

1. **Mouse Down**: Initial detection on appointment card
2. **Movement Detection**: Threshold-based drag initiation
3. **Live Feedback**: Real-time visual updates during drag
4. **Validation**: Continuous validation of drag target
5. **Drop Confirmation**: Modal confirmation with change summary
6. **API Validation**: Doctor availability check
7. **Success/Error**: Appropriate feedback and state updates

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Existing keyboard support maintained
- **Screen Reader**: Appropriate ARIA labels and states
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast for blocked states
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling during modals

## üîí Validation Rules

### Time Slot Validation

- Must be within working hours (8 AM - 6 PM)
- Cannot be in the past
- Cannot be on weekends
- Cannot be on configured holidays
- Must maintain valid start < end time relationship

### Doctor Availability

- Simulated API call with 300ms delay
- 90% success rate for demonstration
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Automatic fallback on validation failure

## üîó Integration Points

### Existing Systems

- **Resize Service**: Completely preserved and functional
- **Appointment Service**: Uses existing update methods
- **Calendar Service**: Integrates with existing date handling
- **Toaster Service**: Consistent notification system

### Future Enhancements

- Real doctor availability API integration
- Configurable working hours per doctor
- Custom holiday configuration UI
- Conflict detection with existing appointments
- Batch appointment operations
